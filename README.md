## 🏜️ texture packs - lyoq labs.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most texture packs are for [Minecraft Java](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition).
> Our texture packs are marked with `Java` or `Bedrock`.
> `Java` -> [Java Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition) `Bedrock` -> [Bedrock Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bedrock_Edition)
> Also make sure that you **HAVE** a PC, because you can’t put any texture packs on Bedrock Edition on **CONSOLE**.
